# ImageClassifier using keras and numpy
An image classifier based off multiple sources:

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAICT4Al5Ow
-https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html

There are two image classifiers featured, the example.py performing faster than the ImgTeller.py due to the number of layers.
I've also changed the Epoch number to 1 for testing reasons.

I've also supplied the weights if you're interested in using them.
